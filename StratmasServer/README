== 1. PREREQUISITES ==

 This project requires:
  * Cross-platform Make (CMake) v2.6.2+
  * GNU Make or equivalent.
  * GCC or an alternative, reasonably conformant C++ compiler.
 The following are automatically downloaded and built if missing:
  * Boost C++ Libraries v1.37+ [HEADERS and LIBRARIES]
  * Log4Cxx v0.10.0+ 
  * UnitTest++ (a.k.a. unittest-cpp)
  * Xerces-c 3.1.1+

== 2. BUILDING ==
 
 This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. However, we
 have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that
 the typical build invocation of "./configure" followed by "make" will work.
 For a list of all possible build targets, use the command "make help".

 NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been
 generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.

 You can speed up compilation by running on multiple cores with ex. 'make -j4' if you have 4 cores.

 To clean compiled code 'make clean'
 To clean CMake cached configuration 'make distclean'
 To generate documentation run 'make docs'
 To run tests './configure -DTESTS=On' and then 'make'
 To run with extra debug output './configure -DDEBUG=On' and then 'make'
 To run with different compiler than default 'make distclean' then 'CC=/usr/bin/clang CXX=/usr/bin/clang++ ./configure'
 Cygwin
   install make, cmake, [doxygen], libboost, libxerces-c, a c++ compiler and bintuils. Ex minggw64-x86_64-[gcc,g++,binutils]
   configure with 'CC=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc CXX=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ RC=/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-windres.exe ./configure'

== 3. INSTALLING ==

 Once the project has been built (see "BUILDING"), execute "sudo make install".
